# Introduction-to-Theory-of-Computation

This is note for Introduction to Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser and his corresponding course on MIT OpenCourseWare. Some of the contents are from CSC240 taught by Faith Ellen at University of Toronto. As I have some basic knowledge in theory, some materials are only mentioned but not discussed. Everything here is open to discuss, and as a beginner and fan of theory, I am pleased to hear interesting comments and serious criticisms.

"The mathematics community has a tradition of sharing materials so that we help each other."
â€” PROF. MICHAEL SIPSER
